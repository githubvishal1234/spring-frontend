Overview and Heritage
Originally developed as a mobility vehicle for military use, the Land Cruiser was inspired by the Jeep and quickly adapted for civilian use, emphasizing robustness and reliability. Over the decades, it has undergone numerous transformations, shifting from a basic, rugged vehicle to a sophisticated, luxury SUV without sacrificing its foundational ruggedness. This adaptability has made the Land Cruiser a staple in over 170 countries, especially in places where driving conditions are challenging.
